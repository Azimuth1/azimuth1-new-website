                    <p>QuickRoute provides custom driving routes to ensure first responders can navigate to an emergency as
                        quickly as possible.
                        Off the shelf mapping solutions like Google Maps are great for everyday driving but QuickRoute accounts
                        for first responders ability to use alternative procedures during an emergency and some of the
                        restrictions that can come with operating a larger vehicle.
                        QuickRoute uses multiple data streams including: A global database of road and infrastructure that is
                        updated daily; manufacturer specs for common vehicle types (Ladder, Ambulance, Crash Truck, Patrol Car,
                        Water, Tender, etc.); Road and bridge weight limits and tunnel and bridge clearance from the US

                                <p>QuickRoute allows mobile and ECC users to tag road obstructions including, hazards, flooding, accidents, construction and other obstacles.
                                    All road obstructions appear on everyone's map in real time.
                                    Routes provided by QuickRoute automatically take road obstructions into account when providing routes.

                        pushing routes to users for hands-free navigation, and pre-planning of road outages. Also you can use the QuickRoute ECC map
                        screen as a low cost AVL system or a backup for when CAD goes down.</p>
