                        <p>Phase 1 environmental assessment reports give a broad high level review of historical,
                          current, and potential polluters near a site.  Our complementary reporting method is
                          a simplified version of our EnviMetric forecast for multiple sites.</p>
                        <p>The ideal scenario is to pair this report with a Phase 1 survey report to get the full
                          picture of the current and potential risk associated with a target site.  Azimuth1 is
                          working with major environmental report provider to integrate our assessments into
                          their products.</p>
