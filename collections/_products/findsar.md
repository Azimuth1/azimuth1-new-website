## Find lost subjects faster
Using search theory has been proven to direct search teams to the most likely areas to find lost subjects the fastest. FIND puts all of the best modern search theory and subject profile statistics into a software mackage that does the calculations and tracking of probabilities for you so you can spend your time managing the search.

Combining search theory with search management support and task mapping, FIND helps you start searches faster so you can end searches faster.
