Automate the processing and exploitation of drone data feeds for Public Safety

## The Lean Process for drone data flow

If you've used Dropbox, you know how to use DigitalVista. You sync your folder of images and video, and within a few minutes to a few hours you'll get an alert that your processing is complete, and the results are already syncing to your devices. It's that simple.

## Measuring debris pile volumes from drone collections

Upload your drone footage or still images and receive a geo-registered image on a web map that can be integreated into other applications. Get a 3D model that can be used to measure slopes, debris volume, water volume, water, vegetation, and road surface data layers for your GIS.

## Mission focused outputs from Digital Vista

Object recognition using state of the art deep learning methods to find objects from your data feed. Save operator time by getting a report of identified objects like caved roofs, blue tarps, sinkholes, vehicles, and more. Create a viewshed layer that identifies vantage poitns for spotters or radio repeaters as well as hidden areas that are not easily observable. Publish your data on a private map layer, or open it to the world to receive assistance in mapping an area from the open mapping community.
