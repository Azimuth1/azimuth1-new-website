## The simplest mapping application ever

You don't need to be a GIS analyst or have specialized hardware to tag and annotate your map.

## Activity specific icon packs

We have built specific icon packs into MiniCarta that match your field activitites exactly. There are icons for public safety, environmental field work, utilities survey, hunting, fishing, real estate and more. We are adding to the icon packs every day.

## Start out for free

MiniCarta's free version has a variety of shapes and colors to choose from for your basic icons. You still get all of the sharing, syncing, and publishing as in the full verision. So you can try it out with your group and upgrade later when you want to use the Pro features.

## Get all your points sent by email

Save your points in text format for download. MiniCarta PRO can convert your project tagged points into GIS, CAD, Google Earth, Excel, and CSV files. So you can share your data with the back office or archive it for posterity.

## Share and collaborate on maps

You don't have to go it alone. Share your map and let your whole team work on the same map. You see what they tag, they see what you tag. All in real time.

## Dozens of maps to reference

All versions of MiniCarta have over a dozen map types for you. City Maps, Aerial imagery, Nautical charts, Aeronautical charts, Topographic maps, Historical maps, Geologic maps, and more.
