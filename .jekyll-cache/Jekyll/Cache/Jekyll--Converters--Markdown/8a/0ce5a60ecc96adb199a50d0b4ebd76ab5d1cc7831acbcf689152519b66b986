I"’<p>In our work with the Department of Homeland Security and dbS SAR, Azimuth1 is designing and building search and rescue software for first responders.  Part of that system is a custom topo map for SAR personnel to use to plan and carry out search tasks.  Recently Microsoft open sourced a large data set of building footprints that they are providing as Open Data.  <a href="https://blogs.bing.com/maps/2018-06/microsoft-releases-125-million-building-footprints-in-the-us-as-open-data">Read more here</a></p>

<p>We quickly integrated that data into the TotalTopo maps for search and rescue.  The difference is very significant and weâ€™re very happy that weâ€™ll be conducting our first SAR exercise using the new maps in Coeur dâ€™Alene ID this weekend.  Hereâ€™s a before and after look at the difference it makes.</p>

<p>Have to give credit to the Bing Maps team for providing this.  These buildings are drawn using computer vision techniques from aerial images, so even though the data arenâ€™t perfect (weâ€™ve found a few building shapes that arenâ€™t out in the world)  They are easy to distinguish from the vast amounts of good data, and having a 99% correct nationwide set of buildings is terrific for SAR and public safety.  In particular the images can see sheds and out-buildings that lost persons may use for shelter or have gotten trapped.  Weâ€™re making updates to the maps in our software all the time to make them better for public safety and other outdoor users.  Look for more info here as we improve.</p>
