<p>Before Azimuth1, Robert worked as a geographer and programmer in the financial services and environmental remediation industries. We learned from Valve to hire <a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/company/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf">‘t-shaped’ people</a>, meaning people who have a wide array of relevant knowledge with a particular area of expertise that they go deep in. We were all impressed with Robert’s combination of GIS, data science, environmental remediation, and programming. That’s us right down the line!</p>

<p>Robert holds a BA in Urban Planning from Condordia U. in Montreal, with Advanced degrees from BCIT and CUNY in GIS and Data Science.</p>

<p>Glad to have you at Azimuth1, Robert!</p>
