I"c<p>We’re excited to welcome Amanda West to the Azimuth1 team! Amanda is a data scientist working out of
Boulder, Colorado and will be focusing on our public health and safety projects detecting fraud in
medical device imports and registrations.</p>

<p>In addition to data science, Amanda brings a background in international affairs, technical writing, and programming.
She earned her bachelor’s with high honors from the University of Michigan and her master’s in
data science from the University of Virginia. Previously, Amanda worked as a data visualization
consultant for the Clark Data Labs.
As a graduate student, Amanda volunteered for nonprofit organizations that worked to improve
the environment, education, and criminal justice sectors in Virginia using big data analytics, data
visualization, and deep learning.
We were immediately impressed with not just Amanda’s technical ability, but her pride in her work and the joy
she gets from solving hard problems. She’s a great fit for our team.</p>
