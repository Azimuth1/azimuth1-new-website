                        <h3><a name="ai" class="anchor">AI Powered Site Investigation</a></h3>
                        <p>EnviMetric is a method of creating a forecast for how widespread the contamination of
                          soil and groundwater is after a leak or spill is discovered. When environmental scientists
                          and engineers investigate these sites it requires many hours of analysis, days of field work
                          on-site to collect hydrology, chemistry, and geology data from the site in order to create
                          a good conceptual site model of the contamination.</p>
                        <p>These models can be quite expensive to develop and they are so important to get right,
                           because all the remediation actions and decisions by regulators hinge on the Understanding
                           of how much material is beneath the surface, how concentrated is it, is it moving, and what is
                           the otherall footrpint of the effected area.</p>

                                <h3><a name="data" class="anchor">Data driven approach</a></h3>
                                <p>EnviMetric is a data driven approach that compiles all of the discoveries and learning from
                                  thousands of prior sites into a single model that describes where the effected area is - how
                                  far from the origin, how widely is it dispersed, and how deep does it go.   By using our machine
                                  learning approach, a branch of artificial intelligence, we can synthesize all of the millions of
                                  bits of information gained from years of site investigation, and fit it to the target site.  </p>

                      and statistical data that put the model in context with actual sites with simmilar geography, hydrology,
                      chemistry, and geology.</p>
